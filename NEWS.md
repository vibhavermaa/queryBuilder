# queryBuilder 0.0.2.9000

## Major Changes

-  Add support for sql.  For an element created using `queryBuilderOutput('querybuilder')`, `querybuilder_sql` contains a string of the query that can be used in a SQL WHERE statement.
-  Removed dependency on `filter_` in dplyr (this function is likely to be depreciated at some point).
-  queryBuilder function can be run without a data frame.  Data frame is only needed when `autoassign` is true.

## Minor Changes

-  Updated example files to test out sql output and rule setting.
